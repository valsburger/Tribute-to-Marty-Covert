	<p>Marty Covert c. 1986</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Marty was born on June 17th, 1963 in East Liverpool, Ohio, the oldest boy and the second child of six born to Carl and Anna Mae Covert.</li>
		<li>As a child, Marty enjoyed being his mom's 'little man' and often took on a protective role in his family.</li>
		<li>He spent his summers cutting the neighbors' grass and his winters shoveling snow to earn pocket money which he would spend on snacks and treats for he and his siblings.</li>
		<li>In highschool he played football, but he was not only an athlete, also a celebrated thespian; he won an 'Oscar' his senior year of highschool for his role as Jeff Douglass in the East Liverpool High School production of <i>Brigadoon</i>.</li>
		<li>
			While in highschool, he met Patti Durbin, a classmate two years behind him in school. They would go on to marry on March 19th, 1982, and have four children: Joshua, Valarie Mae, Jacob, and Julie Anne.</li>
	</ul>

<ul>
	<li>In keeping with his younger years, Marty continued to take on the role of provider. Early in their marriage, Marty supported Patti while she finished her final year of high school by working three jobs: as a security guard at Parson's Coal and Labelle Terrace,
		performing many duties at a convenience store, and loading and unloading barges on the Ohio river.</li>
	<li>After Patti graduated from high school, the couple moved to Corpus Christi, Texas where Marty worked in construction on the Hershey Hotel. Both would later take jobs at the hotel; Marty worked as a bell-hop and Patti worked as room service staff.</li>
	<li>In 1985 the couple learned they were expecting Valarie. Marty decided to enlist in the U.S. Air Force to provide a more stable income for his growing family, and Patti moved back to East Liverpool. </li>
	<li>Jacob came along a few years later, when the couple were living in Phoenix, Arizona. After four years in the Air Force, the couple moved back to Ohio, in Sandusky, where Marty began working at Ohio Bell, which would later become Ameritech, and then AT&T.
		When an opening with Ohio Bell was available in East Liverpool, the couple finally moved home to stay.</li>
	<li>Over the next several years, Marty led a relatively normal, midwestern life. He went to work everyday, bought and remodeled a home for his family, coached peewee football for Jacob's team, and attended band concerts and football games in which Valarie performed. He even made time to take the occasional family vacation to Corpus Christi to visit old friends.</li>
	<li>In 2000, Julie Anne made her debut. She was the apple of Marty's eye, and the two were, and continue to be, practically insperable.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Sadly, in 2014, Marty and Patti separated and were divorced in 2016. Marty continues to be the bedrock of his family; He has helped Valarie move countless times and walked her down the aisle when she married in 2016, has helped Jacob through his own
		marital troubles, and continues to raise Julie Anne on his own. He is beloved by family and many friends far and wide.</li>
	<li>In 2017, he and Julie Anne moved into a new home Marty purchased, and has become quite the host of several social gatherings. He enjoys visits from his older kids and his "grand-dogs" fairly regularly. He still works for AT&T, and enjoys spending his
		time off taking care of his property and pool, attending church on Sundays, watching Steelers and Penguins games.</li>
	<li>He may seem just like a regular guy, but Marty Covert has lived a life filled with the love of his family and friends, the respect of his colleagues, and has always tried to model being the best man he can be even in the midst of trying times, emotionally,
		physically, and financially. He truly is a living legend, one that I continue to admire every day.</li>
